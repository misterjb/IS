%%member(?Elem, ?List)
%%True if Elem is a member of List. The SWI-Prolog definition differs from the classical one. 
%%Our definition avoids unpacking each list element twice and provides 
%%determinism on the last element. E.g. this is deterministic: 

%%nth0(?Index, ?List, ?Elem)
%%True when Elem is the Index'th element of List. Counting starts at 0.

%%!
%%A cut (!) inside a rule will prevent Prolog from backtracking any predicates behind the cut:
